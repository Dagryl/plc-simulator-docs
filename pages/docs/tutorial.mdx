# Tutorial

We're glad to present our tutorial video, a comprehensive guide designed to help you understand and navigate the various features and functionalities of our PLC Simulator Online. Please note, this tutorial was created using a previous version of the simulator, which does not include the drag-and-drop feature and has a different ladder UI. However, the fundamental principles remain the same and the instructions in the tutorial are still valid and useful for navigating the current version. We encourage you to watch this tutorial to gain a broader understanding of PLC programming and how to make the most out of our simulator.
