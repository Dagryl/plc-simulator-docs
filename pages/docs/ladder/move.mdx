# Move in Ladder Logic Programming

The **MOVE** function is used for transferring data from one location to another within the PLC memory. It takes a source operand as an input and copies its value to a specified destination operand. This action allows for data manipulation and serves as a foundational element in creating more complex control logic in industrial automation.

## Symbol

<FunctionBlock
  blockVarName={null}
  inOutNames={['EN', 'ENO']}
  params={{
    in: [{ desc: 'IN', varName: undefined, isRequired: true, value: undefined }],
    out: [{ desc: 'OUT', varName: undefined, isRequired: true, value: undefined }],
  }}
  type={'MOVE'}
/>

## Configuration

One input parameter **IN**, along with one output parameter, **OUT**, are required for **MOVE** function in Ladder Logic. The function block is controlled by two additional parameters: **EN** for enabling and **ENO** for indicating that the block is enabled. Specifically, **EN** activates the function block, while **ENO** confirms its active status.

It's important to note that only **Number** or **Time** variable types are permitted for these input and output parameters.

<FunctionBlock
  blockVarName={null}
  inOutNames={['EN', 'ENO']}
  params={{
    in: [{ desc: 'IN', varName: 'Input', isRequired: true, value: 10 }],
    out: [{ desc: 'OUT', varName: undefined, isRequired: true, value: undefined }],
  }}
  type={'MOVE'}
/>

## Runtime Behavior

When **EN** is set to **true**, the **MOVE** function gets executed. The **IN** is assigned to **OUT**, and **ENO** becomes **true** to indicate the function is active. If **EN** is set to **false**, the function is disabled, and **ENO** is set to **false** to confirm it's turned off.

If **EN** remains **true**, the function will run in every cycle scan. To run the function only a single time, you can use Positive or Negative Transition-Sensing Contacts.

<FunctionBlock
  blockVarName={null}
  inOutNames={['EN', 'ENO']}
  params={{
    in: [{ desc: 'IN', varName: 'Input', isRequired: true, value: 10 }],
    out: [{ desc: 'OUT', varName: 'Output', isRequired: true, value: 10 }],
  }}
  type={'SUB'}
