# Introduction

Welcome to the PLC Simulator Online Documentation! This resource is designed to provide you with comprehensive information and guidance on how to effectively use our PLC Simulator Online.

## What is a PLC Simulator Online?

Our PLC Simulator Online is an innovative platform designed to streamline the process of learning, creating, and testing Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programs. With just a web browser, users can design ladder logic diagrams, simulate their PLC programs, and even share their work with others for collaboration or feedback.

## Who is this documentation for?

Whether you're a student, a teacher, a hobbyist, or a professional industrial programmer, this documentation will serve as your complete guide to understanding the functionalities and features of our simulator. Here, we will cover everything from the basic elements of ladder logic to the more complex functions, offering tips, insights, and best practices along the way.

We continuously strive to improve and expand our simulator based on user feedback and the latest developments in PLC programming. This open-source project welcomes contributions from the community, and you can join our development efforts on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dagryl/plc-simulator-docs).

Thank you for choosing PLC Simulator Online as your partner in PLC programming. Let's get started!
