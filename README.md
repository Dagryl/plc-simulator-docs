## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features for PLC Simulator

Even though the source code of our main project, `plc-simulator`, is not public, we value and greatly appreciate feedback, bug reports, and feature requests from our users. We use the `plc-simulator-docs` repository as a hub for this purpose. 

Please use the **Issues** section of this `plc-simulator-docs` repository to report any problems you encounter or to request new features. Here's how you can do that:

1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/dagryl/plc-simulator-docs/issues) tab of the `plc-simulator-docs` repository.
2. Click on the **New issue** button.
3. Write a descriptive title and provide as much detail as possible in the body of the issue. If you're reporting a bug, include steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. If you're requesting a feature, describe the feature, why you think it would be useful, and how you imagine it might work.
4. Click on **Submit new issue**.

Our development team monitors the issues here regularly, and we'll do our best to address your bug reports and feature requests in a timely manner. You're also welcome to contribute to discussions on existing issues.
